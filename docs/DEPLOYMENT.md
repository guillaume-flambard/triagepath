# Deployment

Design spec section 14: how to run triagepath in production for a
mono-team (the product's target). v1 deliberately avoids container
orchestration and multi-tenant infrastructure.

## Local / dev

- One command: `make run` (or `streamlit run ui/app.py`).
- `triagepath.db` (app tables) and `triagepath_checkpoints.db`
  (LangGraph checkpointer) are created on first run if missing.
- `.env` needs `GROQ_API_KEY` for live LLM calls; without it the app runs
  in offline mock mode (`LLM_PROVIDER=mock`).

## Production (mono-team)

Three supported paths, all single-process Streamlit apps. Pick based on where
you already host things. **Option C (container) is the most robust** and the
recommended default: it pins the Python runtime, which is what prevents the
class of startup failures seen on Streamlit Community Cloud's bleeding-edge
Python.

### Option A - Streamlit Cloud

1. Push the repo to GitHub (it is public: `guillaume-flambard/triagepath`).
2. In Streamlit Cloud, create a new app pointing at the repo, branch `main`,
   main file `ui/app.py`.
3. Set the secrets in the app's dashboard (Settings > Secrets, TOML):
   ```toml
   GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_key"
   GROQ_MODEL="llama-3.3-70b-versatile"
   JINA_API_KEY="your_jina_key"
   APP_SECRET="a_long_random_string"
   DEFAULT_LOCALE="fr"
   LLM_PROVIDER="mock"
   ```
   - `LLM_PROVIDER=mock` is the safe default: Streamlit Cloud has no local
     Ollama, so `ollama` would fall back to mock anyway. With a Groq key the
     UI offers `groq`, which is the recommended provider for site analysis.
   - `JINA_API_KEY` lifts the r.jina.ai rate limit for website analysis.
4. **Persistent storage**: Streamlit Cloud instances are ephemeral and their
   working directory is read-only, so the default SQLite files do not persist
   (the app falls back to a writable temp dir that resets on every redeploy /
   restart — accounts and history are lost). For real persistence, point
   `DATABASE_URL` at a managed Postgres and add it to the secrets:
   ```toml
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql+psycopg://user:pass@host:5432/triagepath"
   ```
   - The `psycopg[binary]` driver is already in `requirements.txt` (it ships
     cp314 wheels, so it installs on the Streamlit Cloud runtime). No app
     changes are needed — every repo function is URL-agnostic and
     `init_db()` creates the tables on first boot.
   - Free managed options: Supabase or Neon. Use the direct/pooled connection
     string they give you, swapping the scheme for `postgresql+psycopg://`.
     Step-by-step walkthrough (provision → connect → verify persistence):
     see [POSTGRES_SETUP.md](POSTGRES_SETUP.md).
   - The LangGraph checkpointer still uses a local (ephemeral) SQLite file for
     in-flight analysis state; that is transient and fine to lose on restart.
   - For an interview demo, the SQLite fallback is fine — just know accounts
     reset when the instance recycles.

### Option C - Container (recommended: Render / Railway / Fly.io / VPS)

The repo ships a `Dockerfile` that pins **Python 3.12** and runs the Streamlit
app on `0.0.0.0:$PORT`. Pinning the runtime is the durable fix for the boot
crash hit on Streamlit Community Cloud (its Python 3.14 has no wheels for the
CrewAI dependency tree); inside the image the runtime is always 3.12, so it
cannot recur — on any host.

Local run:
```bash
docker build -t triagepath .
docker run -p 8501:8501 --env-file .env triagepath
# open http://localhost:8501
```

Hosted (all build the Dockerfile straight from the repo — no server to manage):

- **Render / Railway**: create a new *Web Service* from the repo (it detects the
  Dockerfile), set the same env vars as Option A in the dashboard, deploy. Both
  inject `$PORT`, which the image honours.
- **Fly.io**: `fly launch` (detects the Dockerfile), then `fly deploy`. Fly
  serves the app on port 8501 by default.

**Persistence**: containers are ephemeral too, so for durable accounts/history
either
- point `DATABASE_URL` at a managed Postgres (see
  [POSTGRES_SETUP.md](POSTGRES_SETUP.md) — the `psycopg` driver is bundled), or
- attach a persistent volume (e.g. a Fly volume, a Render disk) and keep the
  default SQLite files on it.

Set env vars/secrets in the host's dashboard, never in the image.

### Option B - VPS (single box)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/guillaume-flambard/triagepath.git /opt/triagepath
cd /opt/triagepath
uv venv && uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # fill in GROQ_API_KEY, APP_SECRET, LLM_PROVIDER=groq
```

Run behind a reverse proxy (Caddy/nginx) with a systemd unit:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=triagepath (Streamlit)
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/opt/triagepath
ExecStart=/opt/triagepath/.venv/bin/streamlit run ui/app.py --server.port 8501 --server.address 127.0.0.1
Restart=on-failure
EnvironmentFile=/opt/triagepath/.env

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Point Caddy at `http://127.0.0.1:8501` with automatic HTTPS.

## SQLite backup strategy

SQLite is a single file, so backup is a safe file copy. For a mono-team app
a daily `cron` + simple retention is enough:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# /etc/cron.daily/triagepath-backup
set -eu
DB_DIR=/opt/triagepath/data
BACKUP_DIR=/opt/triagepath/backups
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
timestamp=$(date +%F_%H%M)
# sqlite3 .backup is crash-safe (consistent snapshot even while app writes)
sqlite3 "$DB_DIR/triagepath.db" ".backup '$BACKUP_DIR/app-$timestamp.db'"
sqlite3 "$DB_DIR/triagepath_checkpoints.db" ".backup '$BACKUP_DIR/checkpoints-$timestamp.db'"
# keep 14 days
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -name '*.db' -mtime +14 -delete
```

Test restore by opening a backup with `sqlite3 file.db '.tables'` before
trusting it.

## Postgres migration path

The schema is portable by design (`db/models.py` uses only INTEGER, TEXT,
DateTime, String; no SQLite-only types), and every repo function accepts an
explicit `url`, so switching is a configuration change.

1. Install Alembic (planned for v1.1):
   ```bash
   uv pip install alembic
   alembic init migrations
   ```
2. Point `DATABASE_URL` at Postgres, e.g.
   `postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@host:5432/triagepath`.
3. Two extra concerns on Postgres:
   - the LangGraph checkpointer currently defaults to a local SQLite file
     (`db/repo.py:checkpoint_db_path`); on Postgres point `CHECKPOINT_DB`
     at a writable volume, or move the checkpointer to a Postgres-backed
     saver in a later version;
   - `DateTime(timezone=True)` uses `utcnow` (naive UTC) today - normalize
     to timezone-aware datetimes before multi-tenant use.

Do not attempt a live in-place migration of a SQLite file to Postgres by
copying bytes; export rows via SQL and re-insert.
